## Further improvement ideas
- [ ] caching the fetched data with sessionStorage or localStorage
- [ ] optimized way to get Planet names and show it instead of urls
- [ ] show the original sorting would be easier to handle if people would have an Id.
- [ ] the \<table> can be replaced with \<div>'s and css grid
- [ ] services can be refactored to be more generic
- [ ] using css vars
- [ ] enhance favicon in normal and dark mode
- [ ] add more Star Wars stuff ðŸ˜‰
